Upon reaching the large intestine, gut bacteria eagerly feast on FODMAPs for survival, generating gas as a result. These processes occur in all people, with and without IBS. However, those with IBS might encounter issues linked to gut motility or heightened gut sensitivity. According to Monash University, consuming a low FODMAP diet showed improved IBS symptoms in 3 out of 4 people! Learn more aBOUT FODMAP<\/p>"
